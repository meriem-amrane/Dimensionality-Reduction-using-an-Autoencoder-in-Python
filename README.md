# Dimensionality-Reduction-using-an-Autoencoder-in-Python
A chard task to complete in the new area of 'Big Data' is to reduce the feature space ( reduce data dimension) since it is very computationally expensive to perform any kind of analysis or modelling.

There is variety of techniques out there for this purpose: PCA, LDA, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Diffusion Maps, etc...Here I make use of a Neural Network based approach, the Autoencoders. In this work we compared between an autoencoder and PCA to reduce data dimentionality, we then used  a function in python : silhouette_score to measure the correction of clustering.
